Zsh options
-----------

  * `ALWAYS_TO_END` moves cursor to end of word if a full completion is inserted.
  * `PATH_DIRS` performs path search even on command names with slashes in them.
  * `NO_CASE_GLOB` makes globbing case insensitive.
  * `NO_LIST_BEEP` doesn't beep on ambiguous completions.

Contributing
