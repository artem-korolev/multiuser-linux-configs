Installation
------------
Installing Zim is easy. If you have a different shell framework installed (like oh-my-zsh or prezto),
*uninstall those first to prevent conflicts*. It can be installed manually by following the instructions below:

1. Start a Zsh shell:

       zsh

2. Clone the repository:

       git clone --recursive https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw.git ${ZDOTDIR:-${HOME}}/.zim

3. Paste this into your terminal to prepend the initialization templates to your configs:

       for template_file in ${ZDOTDIR:-${HOME}}/.zim/templates/*; do
         user_file="${ZDOTDIR:-${HOME}}/.${template_file:t}"
         cat ${template_file} ${user_file}(.N) > ${user_file}.tmp && mv ${user_file}{.tmp,}
       done

4. Set Zsh as the default shell:

       chsh -s =zsh

5. Open a new terminal and finish optimization (this is only needed once, hereafter it will happen upon desktop/tty login):

       source ${ZDOTDIR:-${HOME}}/.zlogin

6. You're done! Enjoy your Zsh IMproved! Take some time to read about the [available modules][modules] and tweak your `.zshrc` file.

Updating
--------

To update Zim, run:
