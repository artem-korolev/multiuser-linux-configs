# One other binary release, it needs renaming from `docker-compose-Linux-x86_64`.
# This is done by ice-mod `mv'{from} -> {to}'. There are multiple packages per
# single version, for OS X, Linux and Windows – so ice-mod `bpick' is used to
# select Linux package – in this case this is not needed, Zplugin will grep
# operating system name and architecture automatically when there's no `bpick'

# Vim repository on Github – a typical source code that needs compilation – Zplugin
# can manage it for you if you like, run `./configure` and other `make`, etc. stuff.
