[Fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd) (pronounced similar to "fast") is a command-line productivity booster.
Fasd offers quick access to files and directories for POSIX shells. It is
inspired by tools like [autojump](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump),
[z](http://github.com/rupa/z) and [v](https://github.com/rupa/v). Fasd keeps
track of files and directories you have accessed, so that you can quickly
reference them in the command line.
