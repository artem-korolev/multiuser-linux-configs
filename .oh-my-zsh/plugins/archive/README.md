# archive plugin

This plugin was copied from `extract plugin`.

Defines a function called `archive` that get list the archive file
you pass it, and it supports a wide variety of archive filetypes.

This way you don't have to know what specific command list archive a file, you just
do `archive <filename>` and the function takes care of the rest.

To use it, add `archive` to the plugins array in your zshrc file:

```zsh
plugins=(
    ...
    archive
)
```
